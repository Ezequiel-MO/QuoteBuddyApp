# Naming Conventions

## Folder Naming

- Use **kebab-case** for all folder names.
- This avoids issues on case-sensitive file systems and improves readability.
- **Examples**: `style-guide`, `contributing`, `best-practices`

## File Naming

- Use **snake_case** for all general-purpose file names.
- This format is readable, avoids case sensitivity issues, and is compatible with most operating systems.
- **Examples**: `good_commit_message.md`, `coding_guidelines.md`

## Config File Naming

- Use **snake_case** for config files to maintain consistency with general-purpose files.
- Include a descriptive name that indicates the purpose or use of the config file.
- **Examples**: `database_config.json`, `webpack_config.js`, `eslint_config.yaml`

## React Component Naming

- Use **PascalCase** for all React component files. This is a widely adopted convention that aligns with React's component-based architecture.
- The file name should match the component name exactly to improve discoverability and maintain consistency.
- **Examples**: `UserProfile.ts`, `LoginButton.tsx`, `Navbar.tsx`

## General Guidelines

- Avoid using spaces or special characters in file or folder names.
- Be descriptive but concise to ensure the names clearly reflect their content.
- **Examples of Good Names**:
  - `user_authentication_guide.md`, `database_migration_steps.md`
- **Examples of Bad Names**:
  - `doc1.md`, `untitled.md`
