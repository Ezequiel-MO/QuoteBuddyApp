# Best Coding Practices

## General Principles

- **Clean Code:** Use meaningful variable names, clear structure, and avoid overly complex logic.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Abstract repeated code into reusable functions or modules.
- **SOLID Principles:** Design code to be modular, maintainable, and extensible.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Prioritize simplicity over unnecessary complexity.

## Node.js Best Practices

- **Error Handling:** Use try-catch for async operations; centralize error handling in middleware.
- **Dependency Injection:** Manage dependencies with DI for better testability and modularity.
- **TypeScript:** Enable strict typing, avoid `any`, and use interfaces for type safety.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests for services and controllers; target 80%+ code coverage.

## React Best Practices

- **Component Design:** Keep components small, focused, and use functional components with hooks.
- **State Management:** Use React Context for local state, Redux for global state; avoid prop drilling.
- **Performance:** Optimize with `React.memo` and `useCallback` to reduce unnecessary renders.
- **Folder Structure:** Organize by feature (e.g., `/auth`, `/dashboard`) rather than type (e.g., `/components`).

## Testing Standards

- **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions and components in isolation with Jest.
- **Integration Tests:** Verify interactions between components and services.
- **Code Coverage:** Aim for 80%+ coverage; use tools like Jest and Cypress.

## Documentation

- **Comments:** Use JSDoc for functions and components; explain complex logic.
- **README:** Keep an updated README with setup instructions and project overview.

**Note:** Review and update this file regularly to reflect new standards or project changes.
